      About LaunchDarkly
    </h1>

    <!-- task 2: include a few facts about the company. Try making this an unordered list! -->
    <p>
      What LaunchDarkly does:
    <ul>
      <li>Our vision is to create a world in which software releases are safe and unceremonious. LaunchDarkly gives product delivery teams the safeguards to move fast without breaking things. We do this through feature flags.
 </li>
      <li>Square, AMC, Intuit, Adidas, NBC, and other top organizations rely on LaunchDarkly to deliver and control their software. They ship code continuously, release features to individual customers at times that work best for them, learn about system performance and user behavior through experimentation, forge partnerships between developers and business stakeholders, and provide value in increasing measure.
</li>
      <li>In a software-centered world, control is one of your greatest assets. Feature management gives you that control, and LaunchDarkly gives you feature management in its highest form.

</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
